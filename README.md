# CODESOFT
CodSoft Internship Projects – A collection of tasks completed during my internship at CodSoft, showcasing skills in [technologies used]. Includes real-world inspired projects, problem-solving, and code optimization using Git &amp; GitHub for version control and collaboration.


• TASK 1 TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
A hands-on machine learning project that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using Python. The pipeline includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and model explainability with SHAP. Includes Jupyter notebooks, reproducible scripts, and performance visualizations.

• Quick highlights / features (TASK 1)
- End-to-end pipeline: data preprocessing → modeling → evaluation → explainability.
- Multiple models + cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- Model interpretation using SHAP values and feature importance plots.
- Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step exploration and scripts for reproducible runs.
- Clean, well-documented code and example outputs.
