## 📌 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

**Description:**
Predict whether a passenger survived or not on the Titanic using classification techniques.

**Tech Stack:**

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

**Steps:**

1. Load and preprocess the Titanic dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Train a Logistic Regression model.
4. Evaluate accuracy and visualize results.

**Goal:** Classify passengers into `Survived` or `Not Survived`.

## 📌 2. Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Description:**
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning.

**Tech Stack:**

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

**Steps:**

1. Load the credit card transaction dataset.
2. Handle data imbalance using under-sampling/over-sampling.
3. Train a Logistic Regression / Random Forest model.
4. Evaluate using precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Goal:** Identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.
